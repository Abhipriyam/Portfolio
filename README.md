# Portfolio
This project is build with the help of HTML, CSS as frontend and Java as backend and Mysql Workbench for the database.
I had eclipse on my system, I have downloaded Tomcat apacher server  from its offical website along with mysql-connector-java JAR 8.0.11.
I have taken templates from the net and used smart alert library as CSS file for alerts.
It has modules such as Sign-Up and Sign-In , after you have signed in , page will redirect to index.jsp which is a final portfolio for the my website.
I had used the knowledge of jsp and servlet in my project.
